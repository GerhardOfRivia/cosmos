## Introduction

Admin has it's own dedicated button at the top of the tools list. It is responsible for administering the COSMOS sytem including installing new plugins, viewing configuration, storing secrets and changing settings.

### Plugins

The Plugins tab is where you install new plugins into the COSMOS system. Plugins can dynamically add targets, microservices, interfaces, protocols, Telemetry Viewer widgets, and entire tools into the COSMOS runtime. The following screenshot shows the Plugins tab when only the COSMOS Demo is installed:

The plugin gem name is listed along with all the targets it contains. You can Download, Edit, Upgrade, or Delete (uninstall) the plugin using the buttons to the right. If a plugin's target has been modified, the target name turns into a link which when clicked will download the changed files. New plugins are installed by clicking the top field.
